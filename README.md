# Axon-Retail-Cars-Analysis-
Company Background:  
Axon is a small retailer specializing in vintage cars, classic cars, etc. However, they are 
facing challenges in managing and analysing their sales data. The lack of a centralized system 
is hindering the sales team's ability to understand the data, leading to inaccuracies in sales 
reports. The absence of accurate, up-to-date sales data is adversely affecting decision-
making within the company. 
Project Goal:  
The project aims to design and implement a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using 
Power BI and SQL to effectively manage and analyse Axon's sales data.
